Yet Another Whitespace Stripper. 

Shamelessly copy+pasted from [End-of-Line Whitespace in Vim (March 01, 2011)](http://sartak.org/2011/03/end-of-line-whitespace-in-vim.html)

Goes well along with [bitc/vim-bad-whitespace](https://github.com/bitc/vim-bad-whitespace).

Simply press `ctrl+<space>` and it removes the trailing whitespaces from current buffer.

## Installation

I strongly recommend to use [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle)
    
     Bundle 'viddo/vim-yaws'

## Why another "strip whitespace" plugin?
I did not want to strip trailing whitespace automatically.
